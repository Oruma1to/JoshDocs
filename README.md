# 2. Word Count Challenge!

## Description
So for this particular challenge I decided to employ the word count features that google has all in vanilla javascript.

## Project MVP - As requested by the take home coding challenge
* Character Count - returns length of all characters using a simple length property.
* Word Count - 
* Sentence Count
* Paragraph Count
* Bigrams

## Post MVP - Everything I programmed to work beyond MVP
* Character count no whitespaces - I tried to make this as close as possible to the google doc app, which also has a character count excluding white spaces, so i programmed it as well using a simple regular expression to seperate the letters by white space and join them back to get the length.
* Modal for bigram display - the modal itself houses a sorting drop down menu, total number of bigram counts, and every single bigram generated from the current body of text. When the modal is closed out, the html is cleared. If the user has not input at least 2 words, the modal will display the message "Type in at least two words to begin!".
* Bigram sort - I added the ability to sort the list of bigrams generated by descending or ascending order. I programmed it in the form of a dropdown menu with sort options. This comes in handy for when trying to identify the most used bigrams from the body of text.
* Highlighted text - I programmed the app to be able to identify what is currently being highlighted by the user and update the counts with the highlighted text. When the text is highlighted, the words "Highlighted" will appear over the statistics indicating that the current numbers are derived from the selected text and not the body as a whole.
